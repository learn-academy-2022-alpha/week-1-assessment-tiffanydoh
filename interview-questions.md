# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement is an if statement where a condition must be met in order for an action to take place. There could also be an else statement where if that condition is not met, some other action will take place. 

  Researched answer: Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed. Conditional statements control behavior and determined whether or not a blockof code can run. 



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a software and Github is an online platform. 

  Researched answer: Git is a software for free and open source distributed version control system where it lets you track/manage code changes. Whereas Github is an online platform that lets you contribute to the open source community and collaborate with others. In Github, you are able to manage Git repositories and track/manage code changes. 



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The relational operator (<,>, <=, >=), logical operator (&& and ||), and equality operator ( == and ===) will return a Boolean value. Boolean values are true or false responses.  

  Researched answer: The relational operator (<,>, <=, >=), logical operator (&& and ||), and equality operator ( == and ===) will return a Boolean value. Boolean values are true or false responses. With the logical operators the OR operators (||) is true if and only if one of the operands is true, it does not need all operands to be true. With the AND operators (&&), both operands or all operands need to be true, in order for the results to output true. There is also the NOT operator (!) which uses the boolean values. With the equality operator, == is loose equality while === is strict equality. 


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index is the position/location of a character within a string, array, etc. The first element or character always starts at 0, next is 1, and so on. 

  Researched answer: Index contains the position of an element in an array. It returns an integar regarding the position of an element inside a string or array. 



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration allows us to perform repetitive tasks. This can be done using loops/for loops. 

  Researched answer: Iteration is repeating a set of computational procedures a specific number of times.  Iteration/loops allow programs to perform repetitive tasks, such as iterating through an array, while following the rule DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself). Loops allow for operation on every item in the array, string, etc. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming consists of a driver and a navigator. By pair programming it allows two people to write code together. The driver is the person in control of the keyboard. The driver has to focus on the task at hand. The navigator on the other hand is the one to look at the bigger picture. The navigators job is to guide the driver by giving their thoughts on what should be done, making sure that the code looks like it's going in the right path. The navigator and driver will switch occassionally so that there is a shared active participation. 

  Researched answer: Pair Programming is where two developers use one keyboard/machine to work together to code. One is a driver where they control the keyboard; writing code. The other is the navigator where they ensure that the code is accurate. It is the job of the navigator to look at the big picture. The driver will have to use the box that the navigator is giving them to choose how to code certain things. Whoever has the idea of what to do will navigate first. Both people will switch positions regularly to build off each other, build understanding, and create an interactive environment. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: These are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or returning them.

2. Jest: Jest is a Javascript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any Javascript codebase. It is essentially a Javascript library for creating, running, and structing tests. It is designed majorly to work with React and React Native based web application.

3. Objects: An object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Javascript variables are containers for data values. Objects are variables too, but objects can contain many values. For example: const car = {type: "BMW", model:"M4", color:"white"}.

4. Method: Javascript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Methods are functions stored as object properties. 

5. Classes: Classes are templates for Javascript objects. It is not an object. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
